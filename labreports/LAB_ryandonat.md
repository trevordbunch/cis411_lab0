# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is: /Users/rd/Desktop/SAaDC/cis411_lab1_CI
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is: cd /Users/rd/Desktop/SAaDC/cis411_lab1_CI

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  

  .circleci/config.yml is the configuration file which provides an on-demand shell to run whatever is needed. This file outlines what the container will look like, and the steps on how it will be built. Conceptually, a Docker is a "container" which allows code to be run exactly the same in any enviornment. Dockers solve issues of compatability when working on code or project from different places and systems.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  

  Line #1 indicates the version of the YAML file being used through a comment, also defined in line 5(In this case, 2.0) 

  Lines #6-16: The jobs level contains a collection of arbitrarily named children. build is the first named child in the jobs collection. These lines also defines the docker container, including the version of node. Here the repository is defined as the working directory

  Line #19-25: The steps collection is an ordered list of run directives. Each run directive is executed in the order in which it was declared. From here the configuration file is running whatever commands are inside. The code is checked out, the cache is cleared, dependencies are checked, yarn install is run.

  Line #37: As commented, there is a test to make sure everything works

  Credit to https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/config-intro/ for explaining the CircleCI and the config.yml file.

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  

  When the build is successful, it indicates that the continuous integration (the process of automatically building and testing your software on a regular basis) enviornment is working, and that there is now a docker container which makes packaging software easier.  

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  

  The configuration file is pretty base level, and not really specialized towards a particular project. In order to take the next step and ready a project for Continuous Delivery, I would try and customzie the configuration towards my project, including specifics for the features of the project, and maybe even some security configurations depending on the total scope of the project.

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._



# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
