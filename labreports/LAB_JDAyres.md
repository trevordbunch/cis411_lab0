  - cd Documents/GitHub/Cis411_lab1_CI 

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
``` json

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
  - This is a program that runs a script that will print "Hello World!" and require a hold for approval to complete the task
  - It will first run to the Dock and run the "Hello World!" step
  - This is followed by fetching the code from the repo so that it can see it and run it
  - Then the code will run the node container followed by the code it collected from the repo
  - then th code will create a workflow which will await me to click and hold for approval to complete the task


- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
  - "version" will indicate the version of the CircleCI platform
  - The "jobs" section will contain a collection of what are known as children, these children will have names and are the... well... jobs that the code will complete
    - Hello-World is and example of one of the children in jobs
  - The "steps" is a collection of "run" directives
  - The "run" directives are executed commands
  - The "checkout" section will fetch code from my repo
  - The "name" sections name what is is you are doing in for that command
  - the "command" section is where you will enter in the command you wish to run at that stage
  - "requires" creates a section of code that must be completed or run, this is why the "Hold-for-Approval" must be completed before the test can be complete


- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   
   When a CI build is successful, practically, it means that the code will run properly in the desired environment and will operate without error and should integrate with the system. Philosophically, this indicates that the programmer or team of programmers methods to integrate the code work.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
  - I would include a more effective and organized method of documentation for the, this would help determine the exact changes for each section of the code. I would also implement multiple test environments, outdated environments to be specific, this way people who may be running on an outdated environments can be included in testing.

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._



# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
- I believe that I did complete this, albeit accidentally, for some reason teh default code in my config.yml file was not there when I set it up so I located this link and used this code.
  - https://circleci.com/docs/config-intro/
  - With this code I believe that I had added more than one unit test
1. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
2. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
