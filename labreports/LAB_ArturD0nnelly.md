# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is: `C:\Users\artir\Documents\GitHub\cis411_lab1_CI`
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is: `cd Documents/GitHub/cis411_lab1_CI`

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
``` json
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "21089d07-26c4-4d2f-864a-9094ccd230d2",
      "name": "Seth Artur Donnelly",
      "email": "artirstepnov@gmail.com"
    }
  }
}
```

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
  - As I can tell, the `config.yml` is used to communicate back and forth between the GitHub repository and Circle.ci. I believe it tells the Circle.ci about what changes were made and information about the project.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?
  - Orbs: If I'm not wrong, these are the packages that help to move from one project to another. 
  - Workflows: This is the set of steps it takes for the build to succeed.
  - Jobs: This is the collection of processes that were already executed. I this case it contains only one job. 
   

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
  If the CI build is successful it indicates that the build has passed all of the steps and that there is nothing wrong (no errors) with the code. Practically speaking, it doesn't mean that the code will do what you want it to do. It just means that there is no error that occurred.
   

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
  The configuration that I would change is the deployment area. Before moving it to Continuous Delivery I would like it to be checked by running through circle.ci to see if everything is okay. Also, the last step in moving the project to Continuous Delivery should be done by humans. The machines and code are good, but it should be finalized by the person.
