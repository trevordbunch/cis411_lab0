# Step 1: Fork this repository
- The URL of my forked repository: https://github.com/bowman3239/cis411_lab1_CI.git
- The accompanying diagram of what my fork precisely and conceptually represents...

# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is ~/OneDrive/Desktop/GIT Files/cis411_lab1_CI (labreport)
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is "cd"

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
``` json
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "d1f46287-f8a1-44f3-8d46-c0bd7f225c8a",
      "name": "Nathan Bowman",
      "email": "nb1298@messiah.edu"
    }
  }
}
```

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- **What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?**  
  It will outline what they container looks like and the steps that it is going to apply.

- **What do the various sections on the config file do?**
  The version in line 5 shows what version of the yml file is being used. In this case, it is version 2. The jobs secction shows what is currently being worked on. Build is one of the defined jobs that defines the docker container. The docker container is using natives of circleci and version 10.3 of node. The steps section is used to checkout the code, restore the cache within certain keys, checking dependencies, run yarn install, save the cache, turn off the node modules, and finally run the yarn test.

- **When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?**  
  This indicates that the build is proper. It can be accepted by anyone and anyone can modify it to fit their own standards. Practically, applications can be deployed at any point. Debugging is also easier when a CI build is successful.

- **If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?**  
  Conceptually, only necessary additions that are needed to push continuous delivery. These would be modifications to the past build, theoretically making it better. Conceptually, this would be like a video game devloper making minor changes from year to year, the game is practically still the same but only small modifications were made.
