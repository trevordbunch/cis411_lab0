# Step 1: Fork this repository
- The URL of my forked repository: https://github.com/RomanSearle/cis411_lab1_CI/tree/purelab
- The accompanying diagram of what my fork precisely and conceptually represents...
- {CREATE THIS AND ENTER IT AS A PNG}

# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is C:\Users\Roman\Documents\GitHub\cis411_lab1_CI\labreports
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is $ cd Documents/GitHub/cis411_lab1_CI/labreports/


# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
``` json
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "824f34cd-c0f1-4408-bc91-3df51e5cbe6b",
      "name": "Roman Searle",
      "email": "rs1503@messiah.edu"
    }
  }
}
    
```

# Step 4: Creating a feature branch
- The output of my git commit log
```
Insert the logs here.
```
- The accompanying diagram of what my feature branch precisely and conceptually represents...

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  


- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
   

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
   

# Step 6: Merging the feature branch
* The output of my git commit log
