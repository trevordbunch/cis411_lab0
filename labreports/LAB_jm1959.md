# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is "C:\Users\mcgil\Documents\GitHub\cis411_lab1_CI"
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is 
  ```
  cd "C:\Users\mcgil\Documents\GitHub\cis411_lab1_CI"
  ```

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
``` json
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "177b884c-95e6-4474-af53-555fb63cc8a6",
      "name": "Joseph McGillen",
      "email": "jm1959@messiah.edu"
    }
  }
}
```

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
  - It is reducing context switching for developers between the web app and VS code through a set of helpful features

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
  - **Orbs:** Are reusable packages of CircleCI config that can be shared between multiple projects
  - **workflows:** Where you can define and evoke the jobs you want to run
  - **Jobs:** Is a collection of steps that will be executed in a single unit 

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
  - Philosophically it indicates that the team is working together seamlessly and there is 
    good communication
  - Practically indicates that the newly coded features will pass all of the required test and will be ready for delivery 
  - Precisely it indicates that the code is written correctly and passed all of the specified tests.
    It also indicates that the code merges well with the pre-existing code.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?
  -   Additional changes I would make in the configuration is add additional documentation to track the flow of code as new changes are added. Also give clearer definition of the tests that will be run to check to see if the new code will work well in the new environment. Another change would be to implement a structured flow of committing, checking and delivering code that way no faulty or un-neat code will get pushed through.
