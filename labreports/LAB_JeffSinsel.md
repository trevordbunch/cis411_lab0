# Step 1: Fork this repository
- The URL of my forked repository: https://github.com/JeffSinsel/cis411_lab1_CI/
- The accompanying diagram of what my fork precisely and conceptually represents...![ForkDiagram](../assets/ForkDiagram.jpg)

# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is ```C:\Users\Jeff\Desktop\Python\GitHub\labreports\cis411_lab1_CI```
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is ```cd desktop/python/github/labreports/cis411_lab1_ci```

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
``` json
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "9499155a-4868-4eef-9295-172615af067d",
      "name": "Jeff Sinsel",
      "email": "js2062@messiah.edu"
    }
  }
}
```

# Step 4: Creating a feature branch
- The output of my git commit log  
_I accidentally added a third branch when setting up circleci so I ended merging the circleci-project-setup to the labreport branch to fix everything_

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing? 
 
The yml file is telling circleci what to do, for example, if a unit test is written into the yml, then circleci will execute that unit test usually through the form of CLI commands.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
  - Orbs: defines which orbs are being used
  - Version: defines version being run
  - Jobs: the step-by-step process for which commands are run
  - Workflow: the order in which the jobs are run

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  

This indicates that practically, if the the CI build was deployed that it would work according to our test and philosophically that we did a good job coding this section.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  

Another job would have to be added in which the code is deployed to a place where the CD is taking place. Specifications about the branch of the build normally filter what is deployed.

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._



# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following: 
- [x] Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
- [x] Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance. (almost, I was so close I got it down to three commands needed in the EC2 instance)
