# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
  ![Use Case Diagram](/assets/CircleCI_diagram.svg)

  It setup an environment inside my branch were it could do various jobs to it. It prepared environment variables, checked out code, restored cache, installed yarn, saved cache, and tested yarn.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  

  hey scanned through my project and installed yarn adn built fresh packages and saved to my lockfile. It restored and save my caches as well. It ran my yarn install to see if it was working.

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   
  It means that the build has no integration errors. The team is working together well and all code is integrated successfully. Through building and tests it sees if errors are present. It allows for a team to devlope together easier.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?

  I would allow the configuration of the build to run weekly to help integrate code together when we release updates. This will be a rapid way to test our system and not allow intigration errors to sustain.
