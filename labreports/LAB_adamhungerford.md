# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  

It seems as though .circleci/config.yml automizes certain parts of the integration process (checking out branches), as well as testing them before merging. 

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
`version` seems to be meta information, or maybe just a command telling CircleCI to use a specific version of itself. The main part of the config is `jobs`, which probably indicates a list of things to do before integration. `build` includes all of the steps during the build process. `docker` probably has something to do with Docker. `working_directory` gives CircleCI a place to work inside. `steps` is an outline of the instructions to follow for the build process. `restore-cache` seems to be a failsafe in case the integration is unsuccessful. `run` installs yarn, which will be used to test later. `save_cache` probably makes a test copy of the project to run tests on in the next `run`.

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  

The new parts of the build do not conflict with the rest of the build in ways that would cannibalize the build (i.e., functional errors instead of syntax conflicts). 

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  

I would like to add logic to handle sending things to different branches, where different actions would be triggered. (For example, changes to the main branch would automatically deploy, while changes to the labreport branch would still trigger testing.)

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._



# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
