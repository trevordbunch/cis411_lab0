# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
  - It has the configuration settings needed to deploy the docker container.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
  - Version: This specifies the version of the YAML file.
  - Jobs: This specifies a task to be done.
  - Build, docker, image: This part of the file creates the docker and specifies what library will be used. In this case, the docker will be using a native library with a node version of 10.3.
  - Steps: The instructions of the config file are placed within steps.
  - Run: This part of the file does the tasks that are specified such as installing or testing. 

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   - When the CI build is successful, it indicates that the build does not have any errors and is ready for deployment.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
  - I would review the security in the configuration file and modify however needed to secure the system.
