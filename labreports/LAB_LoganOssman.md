# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is /Users/loganossman/Downloads/cis411_lab1_CI
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is... ``` cd /Users/loganossman/Downloads/cis411_lab1_CI ```

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  

Circle CI is connecting itself to the working directory, then downloads and installs cache dependencies. It checks this by doing a test.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
   
All sections with a pound sign are comments, which helps to decypger each section. The jobs section holds all of the necessary actions needed to be completed by the config file. The particular job within, build, creates a docker, designates a working directory, and then downloads all of the cache dependencies. It checks the path to make sure it is clear at the end of the steps segment.

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  

Practically and precisely it means the code does not conflict with the main branch, and the code and files can be implemented without any errors. Philisophically it means you are on the right path, and you are verified for the skills that you've achieved. The build is a sturdy one, and it is strong enough for the main branch.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  

I would likely have more tests than "does this connect to your repo". Specifically, I would make sure of spelling mistakes, and possibly ways to check for the code's validity. Can't let broken code ruin the main branch!
