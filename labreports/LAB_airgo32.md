# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  

It looks like .circleci/config.yml is running a series of procedures each time code is committed. This particular config.yml checks out a copy of the code first. Then it checks for a cache. This won't be saved on the first run, but a second run it should find something, as a cache is saved later. As for what is being stored in that cache, I don't know. Then it installs something called yarn, followed by saving that cache that will be accessed later. Lastly, it runs yarn, which I'm assuming hosts a variety of tests for the software.

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
   
The various sections define certain jobs that take place every commit, as well as the steps and details of those jobs. The default commit.yml has one job, which is called 'build.' Then in build, there's a series of steps that occur, which includes checking out the code to be tested, restoring the cache, installing yarn, saving the cache, and running yarn test.

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
   
When a CI build is successful, it means any new changes have not broken the code in any way. An unsuccessful build would mean that something new written didn't work correctly.

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
   
Since this program records data through GraphiQL, I would want to make sure that these new changes can be released without impacting the existing data. More generally, if this project can be run on a variety of devices (such as a computer or a mobile device) then I would want to add extra tests to make sure everything would work in those environments.
