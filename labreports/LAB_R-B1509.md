# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
  <p> It sets up the framework for the code's syntax, where each job is defined than run in the workflow, the orbs set up and run their framework individually from each other so they don't need to be start up and run as separate tasks. Jobs are defined in the framework's set up after the config file is run, then they are executed in the workflow
  </p>

- What do the various sections of the config file do?  
  <p> Orbs runs separate tasks after setting themselves up
  Workflow runs through blocks of codes known as "jobs", of which there is node/test being run. This set up is used after npm start is run.

  After Grading (AG) "Orbs are libraries of commands to use in jobs" - Bunch, Trevor from Rubric Evaluation Comments (REC)
  </p>
- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
  <p> That philosophically the build doesn't crash against itself. Everything was run in a manner which didn't pull from something that didn't exist. Precisely the tasks that are run do not contradict each other and jobs are not missing aspects that are running dependent on another file/configuration. The build's set up was created before the the code meant to run was executed.
  </p>
- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
  <p> Set up the jobs then in the workflow exclude the jobs of latter variations until they are complete.
  
  AG: "Add workflows that pushes your build to a cloud environment" Bunch from REC
