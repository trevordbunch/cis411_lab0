# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
```
This file contains all the configuration settings that are needed to deploy your cluster.
```

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
   ```
   The Docker section is a list of the Docker images that are pulled
   from Docker Hub by the installer during the IBM Cloud Private-CE
   installation process. Essentially it is a library of pre-built images.

   Working directory is my repository.

   Without the checkout step, CircleCI doesn't have my code. Without the code, it can't run tests, complie my code, nor deploy my code.

   Restore cache step with the dependencies allow me to fall back on the latest cache.

   Yarn is an open-source package manager for JavaScript. The packages it installs can be cached. This could speed up and improvie CI build times and it also reduces errors related to network connectivity.

   Saving the cache make the jobs faster on CircleCI. It reuses the data from previous jobs and it also reduces the cost of fetch operations. Caching is about achieving balance between reliability and getting maximum performance. By adding a save_cache step in .circleci/config.yml file, it saves a cache of a file or directory.

   ```

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
 ```
 Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regulary built, tested, and merged to a shared repository.
 ```

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  

```
I would include validation parameters. I would also add security parameters.

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._



# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
