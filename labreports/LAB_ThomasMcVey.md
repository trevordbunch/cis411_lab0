# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
It appears to create an environment for itself to run, then it goes through my github files/code and checks to make sure everything is in order and needed dependencies are not missing, and whatever is needed to be installed is installed and saved to a cache?

- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
Go through various checks and determine how to apply them appropriately to your code so that it can run on any device?

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
That the build is stable, free of potential bugs and can run on nearly any device?

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
I honestly have no idea. I look forward to hearing you explain it to us in class.
