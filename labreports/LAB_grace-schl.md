# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line  
- My local file directory is... 
  - /Users/graceschlauder/Documents/GitHub/cis411_lab1_CI
- The command to navigate to the directory when I open up the command line is... 
  - cd /Users/graceschlauder/Documents/GitHub/cis411_lab1_CI

# Step 3: Run the application locally
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project:
``` json
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "5264da9a-eea2-451f-8141-ac4bcf999d12",
      "name": "Grace Schlauder",
      "email": "gs1241@messiah.edu"
    }
  }
}

# Step 5: Setup a Continuous Integration configuration
- What is the .circleci/config.yml doing?  
  
  - The config file is grabbing (and in a sense cloning) your code so that the file can read it and is then checking the code for errors. It runs a test of the code through yarn which is a package manager, and replaces any errors with new code that edits out the error. 


- What do the various sections on the config file do?  
  
  - The first section, job, encompasses the series of steps that runs in an execution environment.  
  - Next is the build section which creates the environment for the rest of the file by determining what needs will be run and setting it up. In this instance yarn is being used, so it makes sure that yarn is set up before continuing.  
  - Docker is a container platform that allows for applications to be run in an isolated environment. In this step, the circleci image version that will be used is specified.   
  - The steps section contains the collection of commands that are actaully executed in order for the job of the file to be completed. Checkout is performed in this section which checks the code from your working_directory into the file so that it can be used. Without this, the file will not have access to your code. In this section, yarn is installed and then the code is run through yarn. 
  - Restore_cache downloads the most recent cache dependency.  
  - Save_cache determines the new path for the key.
   

- When a CI build is successful, what does that philosophically and practically/precisely indicate about the build?  
  
  - When a CI build is successful, it indicates that the code has been fully checked for errors and all of the error files passed the check.  
  - This bascially means that the code you have is correct and should work properly without breaking.
   

- If you were to take the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, what additional changes might you make in this configuration (conceptual, not code)?  
  
  - In order to take this to the next step and ready this project for Continuous Delivery, I would make sure that there is a way for this file to run automatically at a specified interval (i.e. daily, weekly, etc.). I would also make sure there is a way for the code to be sent out after going through yarn so that any edited errors can addressed as soon as possible.

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Remember to reference at least one other student in the PR content via their GitHub handle._



# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Augment the core project
PR reference in the report to one of the following:
1. Add one or more unit tests to the core assignment project. 
2. Configure the CircleCI config.yml to automatically build a Docker image of the project.
3. Configure an automatic deployment of the successful CircleCI build to an Amazon EC2 instance.
